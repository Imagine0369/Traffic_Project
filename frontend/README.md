# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Commands for running server and website:

Activate the Poetry-created virtual environment with:
~~~poetry shell~~~

Start the Django Backend
~~~python manage.py runserver~~~

Navigate to the Front End Directory (In another terminal)
~~~cd frontend~~~

Run your React application with Vite:
~~~npm run dev~~~~
